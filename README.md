# scVelo - RNA velocity generalized through dynamical modeling

This repository is based on the official repository
<sup>[1](https://github.com/theislab/scvelo)</sup>.

RNA velocity enables the recovery of directed dynamic information by leveraging splicing kinetics
<sup>[2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0414-6)</sup>. scVelo infers RNA velocity using an expectation-maximization framework
<sup>[3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0591-3)</sup>.

## scVelo's key applications

-   estimate RNA velocity to study cellular dynamics.
-   identify putative driver genes and regimes of regulatory changes.
-   infer a latent time to reconstruct the temporal sequence of transcriptomic events.
-   estimate reaction rates of transcription, splicing and degradation.
-   use statistical tests, e.g., to detect different kinetics regimes.
